          <p>In response to the Government of NL's ferry services, our team has taken both inspiration and frustration as fuel to create a cutting-edge ferry reservation web application. This platform aims to provide users with a seamless experience by offering easy access to the ferry schedule while enabling convenient reservation functionality.</p>
          <p>With our app, users can effortlessly search for their desired ferry crossing, make bookings, check their booking status, and even cancel reservations if needed. As an added convenience, the application automatically sends email confirmations to users upon successful bookings.</p>
          <p>By designing this ferry reservation web application, our goal is to revolutionize how people interact with ferry services, offering a user-friendly and efficient solution to enhance their travel planning</p>

          <p>The C++ application aimed to implement Data Structures and Algorithms in a Command Line Application. It involved utilizing Linked Lists, Priority Queues, and Heap to create an inventory list and maintain customer history. The application efficiently handled automatic inventory reorder functionality and allowed sorting inventory based on expiry date.</p>
          <p>To store data, the backend utilized a JSON file, which housed customer and inventory information. Transactions and orders were seamlessly executed by reading the JSON file, updating the relevant data structures, and then saving the modified data back to the disk. The JSON file was parsed using a custom built parser</p>
